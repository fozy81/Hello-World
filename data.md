## Vision - Present environmental data as a web-based service

* Dynamic
* Open
* Reproducible
* Standardised
* Web-based

---

## Example of Dynamic data

<iframe width="700px" height="250px"" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7033208/total_editors.html"></iframe> 

* also happens to be open, reproducible and web-based too

---

## Open

* Open Government licence


---

## Reproducible

* Avoiding building or relying on 'magic boxes'
* Key part of the scientific method
* Version control such as a 'Git'

---

## Example of version control

---
## Standardised

* Web standards such as INSPIRE
* Web ontologies such OWL
* Using standard (and open) web protocols such as Web Map Services

---

## Web-based

* Web services / APIs 
* Data dumps like data.gov.uk
* Different formats csv, geojson, shp, html

---

## What does this mean in terms of SEPA?

* Get all data presentation on to web-based technology via internet or intranet applications
* Build a dynamic, fast database as backend to web-based services
* Move away from crystal Reports, Excel, even PowerPoint
* Open data policy

---

## Constraints

* Improving performance and configuring the backend database
* Training staff to use new web-based tools such as DAVEcology
* Changing culture that everything ends up as a web-based solution - citizen science, performance reports, pollution reports...
* Embedded systems and solutions which don't currently - if it ain't broke

---

### Vision for presenting environmental data?

* Much like this presentation! Dynmaic, open, reproducible, standardised and web-based
* Constraints - hardwork.
