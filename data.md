## Vision - Presentation of environmental data as a web-based service

* Dynamic
* Open
* Reproducible
* Standardised
* Web-based

---

## Example of Dynamic data

---

## Open

* Share & re-use
* Social, collaborative
* Open Government Licence

---

## Reproducible

* Transparent
* Key part of the scientific method
* Version control 

---

## Example of version control

---
## Standardised

* Metadata standards such as INSPIRE
* Semantic web standard RDF/OWL
* Using standard (and open) web protocols such as Web Map Services

---

## Web-based

* Web services / APIs 
* Different formats e.g. csv, geojson, shp, html

---

## Constraints

* Improving performance & configuring the backend database
* Training staff to use new web-based tools such as DAVEcology
* Changing culture to achieve web-based solution - citizen science, performance reports, pollution reports...
* Legacy systems and solutions - risk assess/prioritise

---

## Vision for presenting environmental data -  in a nutshell:

* Much like this presentation! Dynamic, open, reproducible, standardised and web-based
* Constraints - 'All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.'
