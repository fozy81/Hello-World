## Vision - deliver environment data presentation like as a web-based service

* Dynamic, open, reproducible, standardised and web-based 
* Different levels of depth depending on user requirements
* Many ways to access our data

---

## Example of Dynamic data

<iframe width="600px" height="300px"" frameBorder='0' src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7033208/total_editors.html"></iframe> 

* also happens to be open, reproducible and web-based too

---

## Open

* Open Government licence


---

## Reproducible

* Avoiding building or relying on 'magic boxes'
* Key part of the scientific method
* Version control such 'Git'

---

## Offer different levels of access depending on user

* DAVEcology Vs NEMS
>- has to be manageable and avoid duplication

---

## Different ways to get access data

* Web services / APIs - tweet?
* Data dumps like data.gov.uk
* Different formats

---

## What does this mean in terms of SEPA?

* Get all data presentation on to web-based technology via internet or intranet applications
* Build a dynamic, fast database as backend to web-based services
* Move away from crystal Reports, Excel, even PowerPoint
