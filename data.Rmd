## Vision - Presentation of environmental data as a web-based service

* Dynamic
* Open
* Reproducible
* Standardised
* Web-based

---

## Example of Dynamic data

<iframe width="700px" height="250px"" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7033208/editors_in_last_days.html"></iframe> 

# also happens to be open, reproducible and web-based too

---

## Open

* Open Government licence

---

## Reproducible

* Avoiding building or relying on 'black boxes'
* Key part of the scientific method
* Version control such as a 'Git'

---

## Example of version control

---
## Standardised

* Web standards such as INSPIRE
* Web ontologies such OWL
* Using standard (and open) web protocols such as Web Map Services

---

## Web-based

* Web services / APIs 
* Data dumps like data.gov.uk
* Different formats csv, geojson, shp, html

---

## Applying this to SEPA data

* Data presentation on to web-based technology 
* Build a fast database as backend to support web-based services
* Move away from static documents like Crystal reports, Excel, even PowerPoint
* Open data policy

---

## Constraints

* Improving performance & configuring the backend database
* Training staff to use new web-based tools such as DAVEcology
* Changing culture so everything ends up as a web-based solution - citizen science, performance reports, pollution reports...
* Embedded systems and solutions - if it ain't broke

---

### Vision for presenting environmental data -  in a nutshell:

* Much like this presentation! Dynamic, open, reproducible, standardised and web-based
* Constraints - 'All good things are difficult to achieve; and bad things are very easy to get.'
